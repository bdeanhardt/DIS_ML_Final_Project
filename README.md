## Project Overview
Our project's objective is to understand the impact of factors such as location, title and others on the salary of people working in the data science field. This project is being done as part of the Core Course: Machine Learning at [DIS Study Abroad in Scandinavia, Stockholm](https://disabroad.org/stockholm/). Our data was collected from ai-jobs.net by [Saurabh Badole](https://www.kaggle.com/saurabhbadole) on Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhbadole/latest-data-science-job-salaries-2024).
